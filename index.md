## About Me

I'm a senior student major in Computer Engineering at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'm planning to go to graduate school directly starting Fall 2021 for a master's program with focus on computer science or computer engineering. I'm also looking for internship opportunities related to software engineering both during academic semesters or summer break. 

Currently, I'm working with Professor Bryan K Clark on a research project that solves generalized time dependent Schr√∂linger equatinos by using machine learning techniques.
