## About Me

I'm a first year master student major in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I also did my undergraduate degree major in Computer Engineering at UIUC during the last four years. Right now I'm a student in Distributed Protocols Research Group at UIUC and my primary research focus is all aspects of distributed systems. My current research project focuses on failure detection on IoT systems.
